      "deepExplanation": "For a double-click to be recognized as a single action (e.g., to open a program), the two clicks must occur within a specific, short time interval. If the clicks are too slow or spaced too far apart, the operating system will interpret them as two separate single clicks. This means the first click might select the item, and the second click might deselect it or perform a different action, rather than opening the item."

Instead, scrolling is typically accomplished through gestures, such as two-finger scrolling (dragging two fingers up or down on the touchpad), or by using designated scroll areas along the edge of the touchpad. Some older or very basic touchpads might not have any scrolling functionality at all, relying solely on on-screen scrollbars."

      "deepExplanation": "Mouse sensitivity, often referred to as DPI (dots per inch) on gaming mice or simply 'pointer speed' in operating system settings, determines how far the on-screen cursor moves in response to a physical movement of the mouse. Higher sensitivity means a small physical mouse movement will result in a large cursor movement on the screen, while lower sensitivity requires more physical movement for the same cursor travel. Users adjust this setting to suit their comfort, precision needs, and screen resolution."
